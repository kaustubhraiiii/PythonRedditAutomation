# PythonRedditScrapper
This Python program automates interactions with Minecraft-related subreddits by upvoting/downvoting posts based on specific keywords, replying to relevant comments, and collecting post data for analysis, which it stores in a CSV file. It runs continuously, scanning new content every minute.
